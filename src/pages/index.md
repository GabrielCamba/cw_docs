# The Journey of the Polkadot Contract Wizard Tool

The story of the Polkadot Contract Wizard Tool exemplifies how innovation and collaboration can result in the development of user-friendly tools that empower the next generation of web3 enthusiasts, enabling newcomers and enthusiasts to start building without requiring any prior coding knowledge.

## The Spark at Polkadot Decoded

It all began in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during the "Polkadot Decoded" event in June 2022. A group of passionate individuals working in [Protofire](https://protofire.io/) came together with a shared vision: to build something on the Polkadot platform. However, they faced a challenge - they didn't know where to start.

## The Hackathon Triumph

Fast forward to November 2022, the team participated in the [Polkadot Hackathon LATAM](https://polkadothackathonlatam.com/). Their goal was clear: to create a tool that would onboard the next generation into the world of web3. The result was a project that not only achieved this goal but also stood out among the rest. Their presentation, as showcased in the video, highlighted their commitment to making the Polkadot ecosystem more accessible to all. Their hard work paid off when they clinched the 1st prize with their project, as detailed on the [Polkadot Hackathon LATAM website](https://polkadothackathonlatam.com/proyecto-inner/LactobaciloGG/).

## The Web3 Foundation Grant and the Birth of the Tool

With the momentum from their hackathon victory, the team applied for a [Web3 Foundation Grant](https://grants.web3.foundation/). Their [proposal](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/polkadot-contract-wizard.md) was to create the Polkadot Contract Wizard, a tool designed to simplify the process of creating and deploying standard smart contracts on the Polkadot ecosystem.

The initial phase of the Polkadot Contract Wizard was a success. It made it significantly easier for users to engage with the Polkadot ecosystem. It only worked in Rococo testnet, but the team didn't stop there. They envisioned a tool that was not only functional but also versatile. They aimed to expand its capabilities by adding features like:

- Interaction with deployed contracts through the wizard's UI.
- Custom smart contract interactions.
- Shareable contract interaction links.
- Support for multiple chains, including different parachains.

These enhancements were designed to cater to both developers and non-developers, making the Contract Wizard an essential tool for the Polkadot and Kusama community.

## The Second Phase and Realizing the Vision

With the success of the initial phase, the team applied for a [second phase](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Contract_wizard.md) of the Web3 Foundation Grant. Their goal was to continue refining the user experience and expand the tool's capabilities.

Today, a year after their journey began, the team at [Protofire](https://protofire.io) has successfully realized their vision. The Polkadot Contract Wizard Tool is now deployed and operational, thanks to the unwavering support of the Web3 Foundation Grants Program.

## Conclusion

The story of the Polkadot Contract Wizard Tool is one of passion, perseverance, and the desire to make a difference. From its inception at a local event in Buenos Aires to its triumphant success at the Polkadot Hackathon LATAM and its eventual realization with the support of the Web3 Foundation, the tool stands as a beacon for all those who aspire to innovate and contribute to the world of web3.
