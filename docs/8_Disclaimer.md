## Custom Contract Interactions:
When using the Polkadot Contract Wizard (PCW) to interact with custom contracts through the "Custom Contracts" section, please be aware of the following:

**Limited Responsibility**: We provide tools and interfaces to facilitate interactions with smart contracts. However, we are not responsible for the outcomes of interactions with custom contracts that you import into the platform.

**Metadata Import**: While PCW will attempt to import the metadata and interact with the provided contract address on the specified network, there is no guarantee that this process will be successful or that the contract will function as intended.

**Due Diligence**: Before interacting with any custom contract, users are advised to conduct their own due diligence. Ensure that you understand the contract's functionalities and potential risks.

**No Warranty**: PCW does not make any warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the custom contract's functionality or the results of its interactions.

**By proceeding with custom contract interactions on PCW, you acknowledge and accept these risks and limitations.**
