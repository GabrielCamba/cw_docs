# Troubleshooting and Support

While the Polkadot Contract Wizard (PCW) is designed to be as intuitive and user-friendly as possible, you might occasionally encounter challenges or have questions. This section provides guidance on troubleshooting common issues and how to seek further support.

## Common Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Browser Compatibility:
    - Ensure you're using a supported web browser. PCW is optimized for the latest versions of Brave, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
    - Clear your browser's cache and cookies, then try accessing PCW again.
2. Wallet Connection Issues:
    - Ensure your Polkadot-compatible wallet extension is up-to-date.
    - Disconnect and then reconnect your wallet to PCW.
    - Check if your wallet is locked. If so, unlock it and try the desired action again.
3. Transaction Failures:
    - Ensure you have sufficient native tokens in your wallet to cover transaction fees.
    - Check if the contract you're interacting with has any restrictions or conditions that might be preventing the transaction.
4. Platform Responsiveness:
    - If PCW is designed for desktop usage but if it becomes unresponsive or slow, try refreshing the page.
    - Ensure your internet connection is stable.
